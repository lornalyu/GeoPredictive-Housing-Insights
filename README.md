# Predicting Damaged Roofs Through Aerial Imagery and Machine Learning
This Project is sponsored by Emory's QTM department and Neighborhood Nexus. Our goal is to harness Fulton County tax records and high-resolution aerial imagery to predict property code violations and potential abandonment in Atlanta. The initiative will utilize machine learning to analyze patterns and aid in the proactive maintenance of affordable housing, contributing meaningful insights to urban housing studies.

## Project Introduction

### Objective

The objective of this project is to use machine learning to analyze patterns in aerial imagery and tax records to identify properties at risk of neglect or violation, facilitating strategic interventions.

### Intended Use

This system is designed for use by city planners, housing authorities, and non-profit organizations focused on housing quality and urban development. It will enable these stakeholders to identify at-risk properties more efficiently and act before issues escalate.

## Project Partners

This project represents a collaborative effort between Emory University's [Quantitative Theory and Methods (QTM)](https://quantitative.emory.edu/index.html) department and  [Neighborhood Nexus](https://neighborhoodnexus.org/), a non-profit dedicated to data-driven decision-making in Georgia. The QTM department provided the analytical and methodological expertise through faculty oversight and student participation, focusing on the development and application of predictive models. Neighborhood Nexus contributed critical local data insights and facilitated connections with local government and community organizations, ensuring the project's findings were practical and accessible. This partnership exemplified the integration of academic research with community data to address real-world challenges, setting a precedent for future initiatives that leverage data science for social good and highlighting the benefits of collaborative approaches in urban development and policy making.


## Motivation

Urban housing maintenance remains a formidable challenge, especially within economically disadvantaged communities where many homeowners are burdened by the high costs associated with property upkeep. This leads to a degradation of living conditions and, ultimately, the aesthetic and functional decline of neighborhoods. These issues are particularly acute in Atlanta’s Fulton County, where the disparity in housing maintenance can lead to significant social and economic consequences.

### Problem Definition

The project identifies a critical gap in the current approach to managing urban housing maintenance. Traditional methods—relying heavily on physical inspections and resident reports—are not only slow and reactive but also fail to effectively target resources towards the homes most in need. This inefficiency is exacerbated in communities where residents may be less likely to report issues due to various socio-economic barriers.

### Anticipated Impact

The project is designed to transform how communities address the upkeep of affordable housing. By integrating advanced data analytics, the initiative will enable a more strategic allocation of resources, ensuring that help reaches those who need it most. Furthermore, by providing a scalable model that can be adapted to other regions, the project has the potential to make a broad and lasting impact on urban development and housing sustainability.


## Methods and Technologies

### Methods Used

- Machine Learning and Deep Learning for predictive modeling
- Data Mining and Visualization for insights
- Predictive Modeling to forecast potential housing violations

### Technologies Employed

- **Google Earth Engine**: For acquiring high-resolution aerial images.
- **Google Drive and Excel**: For data storage and preprocessing.
- **Python and Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis, modeling, and creating reproducible research documentation.

## Project Workflow

Detailed steps from data acquisition to model training and validation are outlined, focusing on the use of machine learning algorithms to process and analyze imagery data for detecting roof damages.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualizations created from the dataset provide insights into the patterns of housing conditions, aiding in the identification of areas most in need of intervention.

## Results and Discussion

The model currently achieves 70% accuracy in classifying roof conditions. Ongoing work aims to improve this metric and expand the dataset to cover more regions.

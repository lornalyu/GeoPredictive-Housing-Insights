# Predicting Damaged Roofs Through Aerial Imagery and Machine Learning
This Project is sponsored by Emory's QTM department and Neighborhood Nexus. Our goal is to harness Fulton County tax records and high-resolution aerial imagery to predict property code violations and potential abandonment in Atlanta. The initiative will utilize machine learning to analyze patterns and aid in the proactive maintenance of affordable housing, contributing meaningful insights to urban housing studies.

# Project Description

## Datasets
**Fulton County Tax Record** :
Under Georgia law, every property is assessed annually at fair market value. The Board of Assessors issues an annual notice of assessment for each property in Fulton County. Fulton County is committed to helping property owners understand their rights and responsibilities throughout the property tax process.
